# Story-Pitch-Management-System
## Mark Baehr: 1-7-2021

The goal of this project was to provide a platform for the submission and editorial approval of story pitches for a publishing company.
Constraints are placed on authors regarding the number of outstanding pitches they may have, which is dynamically dependent on the type of story they are pitching.
Editorial review is multi-staged with numerous checks to ensure the pitch is properly vetted at each stage of approval.
